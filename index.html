  aims to help researchers get their work done in less time and with less pain by teaching them basic research computing skills. 
  This workshop is designed for researchers and enables non-experts to develop computing skills for research analysis. We will cover 
  basic concepts and tools, such as - working with libraries and data frames; reading and plotting data; creating and using functions; 
  the shell using command-line applications; cleaning and transforming data; and more. Participants will be encouraged to help one another 
  and to apply what they This is a free workshop and is open to all University of California students, staff, and faculty.

<!-- Zoom Installation 

For online workshops, the section below provides:
- installation instructions for the Zoom client
- recommendations for setting up Learners' workspace so they can follow along
  the instructions and the videoconferencing

-->

<h2>Zoom Installation</h2>

<h2>Install the videoconferencing client</h2>
<p>
  If you haven't used Zoom before, go to the
  <a href="https://zoom.us/download">official website</a>
  to download and install the Zoom client for your computer.
</p>

<h4>Set up your workspace</h4>

<p>
  Like other Carpentries workshops,
  you will be learning by "coding along" with the Instructors.
  To do this, you will need to have both the window for the tool
  you will be learning about (a terminal, RStudio, your web browser, etc..)
  and the window for the Zoom video conference client open.
  In order to see both at once,
  we recommend using one of the following set up options:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Two monitors:</strong> If you have two monitors,
      plan to have your terminal up on one monitor and
      the video conferencing software on the other.</li>
    <li><strong>Two devices:</strong> If you don't have two monitors,
      do you have another device (tablet, smartphone) with a medium to large
      sized screen? If so, try using the smaller device as your video
      conference connection and your larger device (laptop or desktop)
      to follow along with Make commands.</li>
    <li><strong>Divide your screen:</strong> If you only have one device
      and one screen, practice having two windows
      (the video conference program and one of the tools you will be using
      at the workshop) open together.
      How can you best fit both on your screen?
      Will it work better for you to toggle between them
      using a keyboard shortcut?
      Try it out in advance to decide what will work best for you.</li>
  </ul>
  This <a href="https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/06/online-workshop-logistics-and_screen-layouts/" target="_blank">blog post</a> includes detailed information on how to set up your screen to follow along during the workshop.

    <p>The default shell in some versions of macOS is Bash, and Bash is available in all versions, so no need to install anything. You access Bash from the Terminal (found in <code>/Applications/Utilities</code>). See the Git installation <a href="#shell-macos-video-tutorial">video tutorial</a> for an example on how to open the Terminal. You may want to keep Terminal in your dock for this workshop.</p>
        <p>
            To see if your default shell is Bash type <code>echo $SHELL</code>
            in Terminal and press the <kbd>Return</kbd> key. If the message
            printed does not end with '/bash' then your default is something
            else and you can run Bash by typing <code>bash</code>

        The default shell is usually Bash and there is usually no need to
        install anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        To see if your default shell is Bash type <code>echo $SHELL</code> in
        a terminal and press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key. If the message printed
        does not end with '/bash' then your default is something else and you
        can run Bash by typing <code>bash</code>.

  <h3>Git</h3>
  <p>
    Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes
    to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public
    version of your code
    on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. You will need a
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/">supported
    web browser</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    You will need an account at <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>
    for parts of the Git lesson. Basic GitHub accounts are free. We encourage
    you to create a GitHub account if you don't have one already.
    Please consider what personal information you'd like to reveal. For
    example, you may want to review these
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/keeping-your-email-address-private/">instructions
      for keeping your email address private</a> provided at GitHub.

        Git should be installed on your computer as part of your Bash

        <strong>For macOS</strong>, install Git for Mac
        by downloading and running the most recent "mavericks" installer from
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">this list</a>.
        Because this installer is not signed by the developer, you may have to
        right click (control click) on the .pkg file, click Open, and click
        Open on the pop up window.
        After installing Git, there will not be anything in your <code>/Applications</code> folder,
        as Git is a command line program.
        <strong>For older versions of OS X (10.5-10.8)</strong> use the
        most recent available installer labelled "snow-leopard"
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">available here</a>.

      If Git is not already available on your machine you can try to
      install it via your distro's package manager. For Debian/Ubuntu run
      <code>sudo apt-get install git</code> and for Fedora run
      <code>sudo dnf install git</code>.
